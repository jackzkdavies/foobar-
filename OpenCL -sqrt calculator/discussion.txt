Discussion of experiments:

For this assignment I experimented with difference methods of splitting the work load.

At first I used multiple loops to split work off, and repeatedly build kernels. This proved to be extremely slow and inefficient.

Once I came across the correct methods to split the work load, I did not notice any great improvements between the working 
global work sizes of 10,000 and 100,000. 
Values greater or smaller did not work and caused errors or freezing with large primes such
as the one given in the brief.

The local work size in relation to the global work size how ever did effect the speed more, but still not largely noticeable.
