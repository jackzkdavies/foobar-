Assignment 3 task 3

I have chosen to implement my assignment using php.

In order for this to work, the script must be run from a php capable server such as Apache,
as well as editing dataBase.php to point to the correct location for that server.

insurance.php is the entry point for this script.

I have hosted it at http://zebulinkelton.com/Uni/337/insurance.php
